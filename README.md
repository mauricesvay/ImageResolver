ImageResolver.js
================

ImageResolver.js is a library that extracts the main image of a URL while saving resources.
Instead of loading all images of a URL, it will try to guess the main image from the URL or the page HTML.

It's like Readability for images.

**Demo** : [http://mauricesvay.github.com/ImageResolver/](http://mauricesvay.github.com/ImageResolver/)

Works without any extra request with:

* image URLs
* imgur.com photo pages
* 9gag
* Instagram

Works with an additional request:

* imgur.com album pages
* flickr.com photo pages (requires an API key)
* any other webpage with Opengraph tags (requires a proxy)
* any other webpage by looking at `<img>` tags (requires a proxy)

ImageResolvers.js compatibility can be extended to more sites by writing plugins.

Usage
-----
The API might break in the future.

    <script src="URI.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
    <script src="ImageResolver.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
    <script>
    ImageResolver.register(new FileExtensionResolver());
    ImageResolver.register(new ImgurPageResolver());
    ImageResolver.register(new NineGagResolver());
    ImageResolver.register(new InstagramResolver());
    ImageResolver.resolve(url, callback);
    </script>

If you already have access to the DOM of the page you can call directResolve, thus avoiding the extra GET request for the html code neccesary in some of the plugins. Furthermore, this gives a direct result without needing any callback. Note that this won't work in plugins requiring more ajax calls than the original html fetch.

    <script src="URI.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
    <script src="ImageResolver.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
    <script>
    ImageResolver.register(new FileExtensionResolver());
    ImageResolver.register(new ImgurPageResolver());
    ImageResolver.register(new NineGagResolver());
    ImageResolver.register(new InstagramResolver());
    ImageResolver.resolve(url, document);
    </script>


Dependencies
------------
I'm working to reduce dependencies, but for now you need:

* jQuery
* URI.js

Why it's hard
-------------
* Website do not set width or height for images
* Images can be lazy loaded
* Pages can be without any image
* Pages are full of ads, transparent gif, tracking pixels, banners
* Images are displayed as CSS backgrounds instead of <img>
* Websites provide a logo as opengraph/twitter cards images instead of actual images
* Flash, iframes and other embedded content
* Javascript generated DOM
* Servers prevent leeching by returning 403 or altered images
* HTTP redirections, HTML redirections
* Authentication
* Image URLs can be relative to host or protocol
